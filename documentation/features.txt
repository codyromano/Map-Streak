DESCRIPTION OF FEATURES

1) Map History: View a map of places where you've traveled. I will use LeafletJS for this. 

2) Tracker: User can track her own location to have it added to the map.

2) Trip Ideas: A list of trip suggestions. Each idea includes a photo, short description and Google Maps link. 

3) Rewards: Three physical rewards - treasure chest-like boxes that are locked. A phrase such as "5 miles" or "10 miles" is painted on each box. When the user travels the number of miles, she unlocks the box. 

4) Login: User can use a pin pad to login and access the feature of tracking her own location.
